Welcome to my University Data Management System project repo. This project is my playground to showcase my data engineering skills – a mix of database magic, scripting wizardry, and Java charm.

What's Inside?
Database Design: Crafted a slick Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the database schema.

SQL Implementation: Got my hands dirty with Oracle SQL to shape the database tables.

PL/SQL: Added some spice with functions, procedures, and triggers for a snazzy database.

Bash Script: Cooked up a nifty Bash script for keeping an eye on disk usage and doing monthly backups.

Java Application: Built a swanky Java desktop app – think student enrollment, grading, and eye-catching data visuals.

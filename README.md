# University-Managment-System-Case-Study-ITI
Project Completion Unleashed! ðŸ”¥
Hey there! Welcome to my University Data Management System project repo. This project is my playground to showcase my data engineering skills â€“ a mix of database magic, scripting wizardry, and Java charm.

What's Inside?
Database Design: Crafted a slick Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the database schema.

SQL Implementation: Got my hands dirty with Oracle SQL to shape the database tables.

PL/SQL: Added some spice with functions, procedures, and triggers for a snazzy database.

Bash Script: Cooked up a nifty Bash script for keeping an eye on disk usage and doing monthly backups.

Java Application: Built a swanky Java desktop app â€“ think student enrollment, grading, and eye-catching data visuals.

Ready to Roll?
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Set up the database by running those SQL scripts.
Sprinkle some Python magic to populate the database.
Fire up the Bash script for disk wisdom and backups.
Launch the Java app and let the data fun begin.

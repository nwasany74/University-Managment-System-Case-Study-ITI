# University Data Management System Project

Welcome to my University Data Management System project repo. This project is my playground to showcase my data engineering skills – a mix of database magic, scripting wizardry, and Java charm.

## What's Inside?

- **Database Design**: Crafted a slick Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the database schema.
- **SQL Implementation**: Got my hands dirty with Oracle SQL to shape the database tables.
- **PL/SQL**: Added some spice with functions, procedures, and triggers for a snazzy database.
- **Bash Script**: Cooked up a nifty Bash script for keeping an eye on disk usage and doing monthly backups.
- **Java Application**: Built a swanky Java desktop app – think student enrollment, grading, and eye-catching data visuals.

You can view the Java project in action through the recorded video [here](https://github.com/nwasany74/University-Managment-System-Case-Study-ITI/blob/main/University%20Managment%20System.rar).
